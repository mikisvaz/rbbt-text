Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) are highly aggressive brain tumors
of early childhood poorly responding to therapy. The majority of cases show
inactivation of SMARCB1 (INI1, hSNF5, BAF47), a core member of the adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. We here
report the case of a supratentorial AT/RT in a 9-month-old boy, which showed
retained SMARCB1 staining on immunohistochemistry and lacked genetic
alterations of SMARCB1. Instead, the tumor showed loss of protein expression of
another SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex member, the ATPase subunit SMARCA4
(BRG1) due to a homozygous SMARCA4 mutation [c.2032C>T (p.Q678X)].  Our
findings highlight the role of SMARCA4 in the pathogenesis of SMARCB1-positive
AT/RT and the usefulness of antibodies directed against SMARCA4 in this
diagnostic setting.
